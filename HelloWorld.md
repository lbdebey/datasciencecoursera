## This is a markdown file

I changed the file to the try to use "git add ." because it was a changed file. Fingers crossed... 

That worked, but I couldn't get it to push. Changing again, try, try again!

Still no push. Third time's the charm?

BAH! the frustration! This time deleted the -u command since my version of Git (Git 1.8.4.2) might be so old that it doesn't use it. (But it was added in Git 1.7...) No luck. Keep at it!

Tried the instructions here (fixing my credentials, see bottom of page): https://github.com/blog/1104-credential-caching-for-wrist-friendly-git-usage
Trying again to push now!

Alas, didn't work. BUT apparently I need to clone the repo to my local directory before I can push to it. Trying that now!
